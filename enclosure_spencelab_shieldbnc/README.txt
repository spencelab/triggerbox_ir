This is Fusion 360 CAD for a simple 3D printable enclosure for a hand soldered GIKFUN protoshield with a single Toshiba TBD627783 driver chip IC into a BNC jack to trigger cameras using the triggerbox code. The triggerbox_sl schematics/hardware on the main spencelab fork of the triggerbox project has a rough circuit diagram. Spence took the tutorial arduino enclosure CAD from this link https://www.autodesk.com/community/gallery/project/21486/arduino-uno-enclosure and rolled back the design to make the enclosure taller to accomodate the shield, fixed the top pegs to go through the shield holds, and opened up a rectangular pass through for the BNC jack.
